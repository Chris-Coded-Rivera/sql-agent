# WIP

SQL functional but app.py is work in progress. If you choose to utilize the agent, the notebook is functional. You must create a .env File with the following:

ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
LANGSMITH_TRACING=FALSE

You might need a langsmith (link here :<a href=https://smith.langchain.com/>link</a>) api key if so include with in .env file:
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
LANGSMITH_PROJECT="your_project_name"

Create a free account and api keys can be created in the settings menu.

Upload your file to directory and substitute the name of the file (***chinook.db***) within the SQLDatabase function arguments.
